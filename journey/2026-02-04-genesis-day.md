## 🎉 What We Learned

### 1. Parallel Development Works
Spawning multiple agents to build systems in parallel dramatically speeds up development.

### 2. Clear Specifications Matter
Each system needs: README, core logic, CLI, config, examples.

### 3. Documentation Is Infrastructure
Building documentation into the system from day one pays dividends.

### 4. Quality Gates Prevent Debt
Automated quality checks catch issues before they compound.

### 5. The Partnership Works
Human vision + AI execution = extraordinary results.
